# Searched Kaggle for a dataset
- Look for something interesting, practical, and simplistic for a beginner <br>

# Explored the data in Excel 
- Identified data to clean up. <br>
- Distinguished alphanumeric user ids for future information analysis. <br>
- Explored into the inconsistency in date formatting: Some with slashes, and some in dashes. Made it consistent by formatting as YYYY/MM/DD. <br>

# Utilized pivot tables to summarize key information
- Looked at revenue per category - all relatively within the same amt <br>

- Explored the success of top earning category versus lowest: 14.78% increase in profit from electronics to clothing. <br>
- Investigated why: Compared their # of sales, average price, and average discount of the items - Metrics were all close. <br>

# Next steps
- Create what if scenarios for increasing avg discount of electronics from 19.27% to 20% <br>
- Investigate items that may be outperforming others <br>
  - All 531 instances of clothing were unique. No sales were heavily dependent on one “star” item. Unrealistic data for the real world, but debunks an outperforming item for this particular dataset. <br>
- Look for outlier items with drastic price differences.
- Place into buckets for items that are making good sales. I.e. prices > 400, 300 to 400, with and without discounts?
- Check for time trends - Seasonal growth or slow downs?

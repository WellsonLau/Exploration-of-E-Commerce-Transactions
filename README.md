# Exploration-of-E-Commerce-Transactions
The goal of this project is a documentation as a beginner, to intrdouce myself the tools that are used for data analytics. <br>
A dataset that spoke to my interests: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/steve1215rogg/e-commerce-dataset/data. <br>
This is a simple fictional dataset regarding a ledger of e-commerce transactions. <br>
It was a good mix of learning new tools with simple dataset, and using it to generate actionable insight from practical data. <br>

# Excel
I opened up the dataset in excel, and it opened up with the following parameters: 
User_ID	| Product_ID	| Category	| Price (Rs.)	| Discount (%)	| Final_Price(Rs.)	| Payment_Method	| Purchase_Date
The columns itself are straightforward, but I had two questions right off the bat:
- The User_ID field had both alphanumeric and just numbers as variables. Why?
- The purchase dates had two different formats, one that used slashes, and the other that used dashes. Would I have to clean this up?
